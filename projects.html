              <p class="mb-5">
                Candice's Help Desk is now powered by punk, many cups of coffee,
                and Jira! It's a popular ticketing system used by so many. I now
                have an important and desired compantcy. Since being a grad
                student my personal life became a help desk. I was relying on
                Microsoft OneNote, Samsung Notes, and scrawls of paper. This is
                a rad and proper organizational tool. I already issued my
                husband a ticket for that laptop problem showed on this page. I
                gave it a high rating as that thing really needs help! Also from
                now on I'm not gonna code a seperate external app for everything
                on here. If It's bloggy it doesn't need one. Cool coded games
                and seperate tech projects get deployed to a seperate app! I
                want things I do obviously attetched to my name and URL. I'm
                dating work on here now to to make rad documentation--March 14,

                  My husband's laptop was falling apart. I had to do some recon
                  work so I could plan the repair. I coded the recon work to
                  document the journey. This is going to be a project. I did
                  this March 9, 2024.

                Replacing a "non-removable" mobile phone battery
              </h2>
              <p class="mb-5">
                This isn't the prettiest thing I've coded, but the intent wasn't
                to show how pretty I can code. The intent was to show how I
                solved a real-world problem. My spouse was having issues with a
                cell phone. The battery was showing signs of dying. It had
                moments of rapidly losing a charge. Once I ruled out other
                possible issues as the reason for the drain, I deduced it was
                the battery. In this, I solve the issue of replacing a
                non-removable battery in a mobile device. This is my work on an
                LG K51 where the "non-removable" battery is hooked up to the
                motherboard. I replaced the battery. 1.5 months later, the new
                battery is holding the charge like a champ. December 2023.
