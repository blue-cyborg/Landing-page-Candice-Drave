                is a YouTuber I have been watching on my coding journey. I've
                always loved old-school video games and spent my share of
                quarters and hours playing this game, although I got to say the
                Atari 2600 port is thoroughly my favorite version. I've wanted
                some more JavaScript tutorials to work on, as JS is challenging
                but rewarding. It can be Lots of files getting imported into
                other files. It gets called vanilla JS, but I don't know if
                learning JS isn't always vanilla or simple. I had never tried to
                make a game before, and since I love the old-school, this was a
                perfect tutorial to take a stab at. Shout out to Coding with
                Adam as they linked the Git Hub code in the video description,
                which helped as I replayed some parts and then went, "oh, that's
                what you're doing." The final game reminds me of a simple, early
                2000s flash game that you play when the teacher in the library
                of the high school is like, "2 + 2 = 4 and research papers," and
                I'm just like, "yeah, I'm gonna play flash games and drive
                Sponge Bob's car around Bikini Bottom like I stole it" Simple
                online games rule! I want to make more online games.

                  is another YouTuber I dig and cool fellow guitar player, well
                  bass in my case as I just want to play some Ramones songs
                  really loud. I've been wanting more JavaScript help and found
                  this cool analog clock tutorial. I know it's not the most
                  practical thing, as we all have a glowing light box called the
                  phone in our pockets, but I still carry a pocket watch and
                  think different clocks are pretty dope. Looking at you Nixie
                  Tube Clock, which, if you've never seen one, check out

                  While not practical, a computerized online analog clock was a
                  blast to make. I had to make my gradient loud because why not?
                  I found a cool pride flag gradient, so it's pride o'clock
                  anytime this bad boy is running üëç. I liked the math part of
                  this. It wasn't anything that would have come naturally to me
                  without the tutorial, and the math portions were total food
                  for thought.

                exercise. It's not one of the projects; it's just one of the
                exercises. However, I thought it was pretty cool and wanted to
                put it here. It's kind of boring looking on sight, but it's
                another thing I'm happy to put in my tool kit. Usually, when
                I've made tables, I've used Bootstrap. In this exercise, I
                learned to make tables using HTML and CSS. While Bootstrap is an
                excellent front-end framework that I'm more inclined to use than
                doing this, it was still awesome to learn a fundamental skill.
                I'm loving Free Code Camp!
