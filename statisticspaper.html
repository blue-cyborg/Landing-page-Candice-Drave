        <h2 class="paper">Evaluate an Application of Inferential Statistics</h2>
        <p>
          Inferential statistics have many real-world technological and
          engineering applications. The focus of this work is how inferential
          statistics shaped the outcome of the Second World War. Inferential
          statistics played a role in the United Kingdom’s code-breaking
          research. Scholars in the United Kingdom used statistics to understand
          German encrypted messages produced from Enigma machines. This work
          will cover what Enigma machines were and how statistical principals
          were used to break the codes.
        </p>
        <h2 class="paper">The Technology Behind the Event</h2>
        <h3 class="paper">The Enigma</h3>
        <p>
          The Enigma, as shown in Appendix A, was a German cipher machine used
          in World War II (Bundesarchiv Bild, 2016). In looking at Appendix A,
          the part where the hands are typing on the typewriter-style keys is
          where the person would write the message. The letters above the keys
          light up. This section shows what letter goes in the code. For
          example, if someone were to push the letter s on the typewriter
          section this section might light up with the letter h. However, if
          that person were to push s again it would not come out h again. It
          would come out a different letter. Before such a machine, the code
          would have stayed the same uniform throughout the writing. S would
          have stayed h through the entire message. An example of this is the
          style of code Anne Lister devised and used in her Regency-era diaries.
          Her writings steadily utilize a code that combines letters,
          mathematical symbols, punctuation, and zodiac symbols that during her
          lifetime concealed her innermost thoughts and feelings.
        </p>
        <h3 class="paper">How it Worked</h3>
        <p>
          Though it may seem strange that pushing the same letter twice would
          produce different symbols, it was cyphertext that was part of a very
          complex system. The Enigma device was battery powered. If one looks at
          Appendix A, the top right of the board has a plate that is bolted
          down. The battery was under this plate. Next to this is three rotors.
          Professor Brailsford also is known as Computerphile (2014) explained
          that these rotors have 26 letters engraved around their circumference.
          The rotors are responsible for the cyphertext. The rotor on the right
          moves the fastest, and after so many clicks, the next rotor is nudged,
          and so on. In between each of the rotors is an input stud and an
          output stud. Looking between each of the rotors is like looking at a
          jumble of wires. Each input stud is wired to an output stud. At the
          beginning of the Enigma’s lifecycle, there were three types of rotor
          wheels, and each one had its own configurations. A style one rotor
          would never be configured in a fashion identical to wheel two or
          three. Computerphile (2014) explained that the number of possible
          configurations is 3! Upon receiving a message, the Germans would
          reverse the circuit to decode the ciphertext. The circuit then worked
          in reverse. The code was entered on the typewriter portion, and the
          plain text letter showed up on the section that lit up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things could get even more complex and unique because the front of the
          Enigma looked like an old-style telephone operator board. This was
          called a plugboard (Appendix B). Custom wiring configurations could be
          devised here. The Germans had codebooks to create and decipher these
          messages.
        </p>
        <h2 class="paper">The Event</h2>
        <p>
          During World War II Britain’s best minds utilized their skills for the
          war effort at Bletchley Park. Bletchley’s role was that of
          codebreaking. There were rooms filled with linguists, mathematicians,
          chess champions, and people recruited from an incredibly tricky Daily
          Telegraph crossword competition (Central Intelligence Agency, 2015).
          The computer pioneer Alan Turing was a crucial individual at
          Bletchley. While he is often remembered now for devising the Turing
          Test, it was his math skills that were imperative to this
          cryptological study.
        </p>

        <h3 class="paper">Role of Statistics</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout the lifecycle of the Enigma, there were five rotor wheels.
          Alan Turing used statistics to make sense of the thousands of possible
          configurations that the Enigma was capable of. James Grime, also known
          on YouTube as the Numberphile (2013) explains that there are 60 ways
          that one could arrange three rotors from a selection of five rotors.
          This number comes from the idea that on the first reach in there are
          five rotors, then four, then three, which turns into the equation 5 *
          4 * 3 = 60. As far as starting positions go, a similar idea is
          followed. Each wheel has 26 starting positions, so 26 * 26 * 26 =
          17,576 possible starting positions. That is just assuming rotor use
          and not custom plug board configurations which made things extra
          jumbled. On the plugboard there ten cables that connect two letters
          and make a pair. Numberphile (2013) explained that the following
          formula is used to understand the complexity of the plugboard
          scrambling.
        </p>
        <img src="images/stats1.png" class="img-fluid stats" alt="equation" />
        <p>
          This breaks down to 150,783,274,937,250. The Numberphile (2013) found
          that with the rotors and the plugboard that there were
          158,962,555,217,826,360,000 possible combinations. With so many
          possible configurations approaching the Enigma statistically involved
          probability and elements of hypothesis testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turing approached probability using an urn model, and the name of the
          approach is now called the Good-Turing approach. It is an empirical
          Bayes method. The probability mathematics focused on the expected
          frequency of words within a population of words. This concept is that
          the expected population frequency could be thought of as r and
          expressed in the formula (r + 1)nr+1/(Nnr) (Mardia and Cooper, 2012).
          N is the population, and nr represents distinct words represented
          exactly r times in the sample. Specifically, the formula is finding
          the probability that the next word is one that has not been sampled
          yet. A confidence interval was applied, such as 98% to state the
          minimum size of the vocabulary. Meaning 98% of the words were likely
          to show up in a dictionary. Turing did throw on a non-zero probability
          in case if some words had a letter grouping that had not shown up yet
          in his data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The probability of a letter repeating had to be thought of as well.
          This is the probability that two letters in different places will
          represent the same letter of the alphabet and can be expressed as
          Σp_1^2. In a hypothetical situation, h occurs v_h times within a
          sample N. Good (1979) states that Turing plugged the concept into Σ
          v_h (v_h - 1)/{N(N - 1)}.
        </p>
        <h3 class="paper">The Roles of Engineering and Technology</h3>
        <p>
          The hypothesis testing elements relate directly to the roles of
          engineering and technology. The Enigma had a critical flaw in its
          design. That flaw was that a letter was never itself. If someone
          pushed t, it was never encoded as t. Turing and others at Bletchley
          knew certain words that commonly showed up in the messages. The flaw
          of the Enigma and knowing certain words that commonly showed up helped
          Turing and Gordon Welchman create and code a machine. It was called
          the Bombe and could decrypt messages in about 20 minutes (Numberphile,
          2013). The Bombe focused on deciphering the plugboard settings. As
          mentioned before the plugboard allowed for the configuration of 10
          pairs of letters. Numberphile’s (2013) explanation of how the Bombe
          worked sounded like the beginning of a hypothesis test. Someone at
          Bletchley would create a null hypothesis. In a hypothetical scenario,
          this is b equals g, or b is connected to g on the plugboard. The
          alternate hypothesis is that b does not equal g, or b is not connected
          to g on the plugboard.
        </p>
        <h3 class="paper">Beneficial Alternative Roles or Procedures</h3>
        <p>
          The above set up is as far as the hypothesis test concept goes. Both
          Numberphile (2013) and Good (1979) found that the null hypothesis was
          accepted or rejected not around a significance level but rather
          through a search tree methodology. This is a concept from graph
          theory. The search tree deduces connections through accepting and
          rejecting data. The tree looks something like this.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/stats2.png"
          class="img-fluid stats"
          alt="search tree"
        />
        <p>
          In the mock scenario, the null hypothesis is b is equal to g. They are
          plugged into the first part of the tree. G has to go through the
          rotors and then becomes d and comes out y. The updated tree now looks
          like this.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/stats3.png"
          class="img-fluid stats"
          alt="updated search tree"
        />
        <p>
          Through this, it is now deduced that d and y share a connection on the
          plugboard. Next, in the hypothetical scenario, the below image
          happens. From this, it can be deduced that P and M are connected on
          the plugboard.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/stats4.png"
          class="img-fluid stats"
          alt="updated search tree"
        />
        <p>Next, in the hypothetical scenario, this image is the outcome.</p>
        <img
          src="images/stats5.png"
          class="img-fluid stats"
          alt="updated search tree"
        />
        <p>
          This image is showing that the null hypothesis is incorrect. B cannot
          be simultaneously connected to both g and z at the same time. A
          contradiction is apparent. B is not wired to g. Instead, b is wired to
          z. One would have to run b through all 26 options. If all 26 options
          presented a contradiction, then the rotor position was set at an
          incorrect interval. Turing used algorithmic logic to save time. From
          the contradiction it is apparent that D and Y and P and M are not
          connected and therefore would not be tested. The results from the
          contradictions helped speed up the process, as there is no point in
          testing a connection that has already been deemed as false.
        </p>
        <h2 class="paper">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Turing and others at Bletchley used statistics in the real-world event
          of understanding the complex German Enigma cyphertext machine.
          Specifically, their work was a cross between inferential statistics
          and graph theory. Due to one vital flaw, they cracked a very complex
          code. The result of their study and the creation of the Bombe saved
          lives and impacted history. By knowing messages, Allied forces could
          then sabotage Axis activity. While many white paper publications show
          that statistics shape our understanding and engineering of technology
          it is remarkable to look at the story of the Enigma and see that the
          study can save lives and change the course of history. Understanding
          inferential statistics have vital real-world implications.
