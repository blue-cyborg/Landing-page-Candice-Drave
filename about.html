        <h1>Hi. I'm Candice </h1>
      </header>
        <p>Hi, I'm Candice. I like coding. I just like doing things with computers and technology
        in general. I've had a varied educational background. I started in the arts and made a 
        master's program and thesis focused on the history of technology and how it has 
        shaped culture. When I graduated from that program, I decided to chase my true love of 
        tech. I am currently a Ph.D. student in a technology and innovation management program. 
        I've made a share of assignments about building inclusive projects and LGBTQ+ projects. 
        Building inclusive technology projects and LGBTQ+ projects are something I care deeply 
        about.  All tech should be inclusive, and also all LGBTQ+ people should have resources at 
        their fingertips and be thought of when making policies and strategies. Growing up queer
        shaped this part of me. Since my teen years, I have wanted to learn to code. Over this past 
        year, I became serious about it and am working through all the SheCodes programs and certificates.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Outside of tech, I love taking care of my beta fish and turtle family. I love my 
        partner of 13 years, Tom. I am really into collecting old video 
        games and playing them on my Retron 5. I'm a drag king. I'm a huge nerd about pizza.  
        Any house I live in has to have a pizza stone and electric oven that I can make super 
        hot.  I love crafting my own dough, sauces, and cheese blends. I want to make an original 
        great NY style pizza.
