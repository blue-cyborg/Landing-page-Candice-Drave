      <h1>Artificial Intelligence for Bisexual Lives and Identities</h1>
      <h2>December 2019</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="container-paper">
      <h3 class="paper">Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        This work aims to represent LGBTQ+ identities in Artificial Intelligence
        (AI). The work presents a document to train or code a BiBot, a bisexual
        chatbot, with resources for Bisexuals living in the United States.
        Bisexuals are the largest non-heterosexual orientation. Despite being
        the orientation with the largest share of people, bisexuals are either
        overlooked or lumped together with gay and lesbian populations. While
        there is some overlap with the gay and lesbian experience, bisexuals
        have their unique minority stressors. This work utilized both
        qualitative and quantitative research to pinpoint those issues to make
        the training or coding document. Many bisexuals feel like they are
        facing the unique minority stressors on their own, which is problematic
        and isolating for many. There are two goals of this AI. The first is to
        promote bivisibility, which is being bi and out, open, and proud. The
        second is to fight bi-erasure, which is when bisexuality is when people
        treat bisexuality like it is not a real and legitimate identity or deny
        that bisexuality even exists. The result of this research and the
        creations of BiBot is a way for bisexuals not to feel alone, invisible,
        and know that they have a valid identity.
      </p>
      <h3 class="paper">Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        The Williams Institute found that when examining non-heterosexual
        orientations, 17% identify as lesbian, 31% identify as gay, and 52%
        identify as bisexual (Gates, 2011). Even though bisexuality is the
        sexual orientation that comprises the majority of non-heterosexual
        identities, it is a highly misunderstood sexual orientation that lacks
        visibility and representations. It is not being half gay and half
        straight and is its own state. Bisexuality can be defined as an
        attraction to more than one gender, and it does not have to be along the
        lines of the gender binary or 50% liking men and 50% liking women. Many
        frame the concept using the definition set forth by bisexual advocate
        Robyn Ochs (n.d.) " the potential to be attracted – romantically and/or
        sexually – to people of more than one sex and/or gender, not necessarily
        at the same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily
        to the same degree.”
      </p>
      <p>
        How bisexuals are misunderstood can be damaging. The creation or,
        hopefully, creations of a BiBot inform and empower bisexual lives. The
        document to train or code is intentionally not in a coding language to
        promote creativity and bi-visibility. The intent is that many creators
        will use this information and add to it to create many different
        incarnations of BiBot for people to find and chat with. Not everyone has
        an assembled LGBTQ+ community near them that they can access and talk
        with, and not everyone can come out. Therefore, for many people, a chat
        with the proposed AI may be one of the few ways to feel like their
        identity is valid and important, and access LGBTQ+ information and
        perspectives. The document to train or code is framed around potential
        human input, and what BiBot’s responses should be like. BiBot speaks
        friendly and in simple language because people of all ages and walks of
        life should be able to chat with them. A lot of people do question their
        sexual orientation at a young age. The Pew Research Center (2013) found
        that age 13 was the median age in which bisexual individuals first felt
        that they might not be heterosexual. This work walks through the
        information in the training or coding document, and why those concepts
        are present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before examining the components of this AI project, there are a variety
        of identities under what is known as the bi+ umbrella. These are
        pansexual, sexually fluid, no label, queer, and a variety of other
        orientations. This work is not looking to slight those specific
        identities, and BiBot is intended and should also be modified to assist
        these identities too. The term bisexual is used because these identities
        branch off the concept of bisexuality.
      </p>
      <h3 class="paper">Materials & Methods</h3>
      <p>
        The training or coding document was made through reading LGBTQ+
        organization websites who often make reports of current LGBTQ+ research.
        LGBTQ+ organizations who compile statistical data get their data from
        reputable groups who specialize in data collecting like the Pew Research
        Center or the Williams Institute. The data reports and explanations from
        LGBTQ+ organizations were juxtaposed with journal publications and
        published first-person narratives. The collection of first-person
        narratives from magazines and online publications put voices, emotions,
        and experiences to the statistical data. The intent of some of the
        informal narrative sources is to make the concept more accessible. It is
        important for BiBot to be a knowledgeable member of the LGBTQ+ community
        and for end-users to feel like they are talking to a conversational
        fellow bisexual person. If people feel like they are talking to AI, they
        might not turn to the technology to ask about resources. For some BiBot
        could be the only bisexual or LGBTQ+ identity that the person can chat
        with, so therefore it is important to add authenticity to the AI.
      </p>
      <h3 class="paper">Results</h3>
      <h4 class="paper">
        Section 1—Defining the Orientation and Thinking About Identity
      </h4>
      <p>
        Many people in the LGBTQ+ community feel that coming out never ends.
        However, the first person that a person must come out to is themselves.
        For someone coming out to themselves, they need to know what bisexuality
        is, and that is a real identity. The definition and the Ochs (n.d.)
        quote are used. The common myths and stereotypes are discussed and were
        informed by Dallara (2011). For many people internalizing the myths and
        stereotypes make it hard for them to understand what bisexuality is and
        impedes their ability to have a moment of realization on whether that is
        their identity. This is also why the Trevor Project Coming Out: A
        Handbook for LGBTQ Young People is also suggested (The Trevor Project,
        2019) to the end user. This online book though aimed at youth, is an
        easy read for anyone questioning to understand the subjects of sexual
        orientation and gender identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        After having that initial coming out to self, many people wonder what it
        means to live authentically. Bi.org (2019) is recommended for people as
        a resource. It is affiliated with The American Institute of Bisexuality
        and the Journal of Bisexuality. There are interviews, movies,
        television, music, and books on the website so people can see other
        people and representations that look like their lives and feelings.
      </p>
      <h4 class="paper">Section 2—Coming Out</h4>
      <p>
        As stated, before the coming out process is never-ending. Every bisexual
        person has a unique story and set of life circumstances. For many, the
        next step is to come out to romantic partners, friends, and family.
        However, compared to other orientations, bisexuals are considerably less
        likely to come out to important people in their lives. The Pew Research
        Center (2019) found that 75% of gay and lesbian individuals were out to
        all or most, while only 19% of bisexuals answered this way. Some common
        fears are discussed in the coding and training document, and users are
        pointed to the Human Rights Campaign’s (2016) guide specifically
        designed for bisexual people who want to come out. Because families and
        allies often need support and advice, the link to the PFLAG (2019)
        website is provided for the end-user to give to people in their lives
        who may need assistance or want information.
      </p>
      <h4 class="paper">Section 3—Perceptions</h4>
      <p>
        The Human Rights Campaign (2015) explains that bisexuals can face a form
        of double-sided discrimination that comes from both heterosexuals and
        gay and lesbian orientation. Many do not see it as a legitimate
        orientation and have perceptions informed by negative stereotypes such
        as bisexuals are confused and promiscuous. Whether or not bisexual
        people are out or not, they still deal with perceptions from people on
        the outside looking in, they are dealing with perceptions in their
        romantic relationships, and the perceptions can be challenging to deal
        with. While there are some scientific studies on some aspects, it was
        more useful to perform digital fieldwork by reading posts on the
        bisexual and pansexual side of LGBT Chat (n.d.) and reading first-person
        narratives from people whose relationships look “straight” or “gay.”
        These works included: Lang (2019) Marusic (2017), Milton (2018), and
        Venti (2015). All these sources put voices, feelings, and experiences
        into bisexual identities and lives and the way their relationships look
        from the outside. The goal of the digital fieldwork performed to make
        BiBot seem more human, relatable, and easy to talk with.
      </p>
      <h4 class="paper">Section 4—An Issue Not Covered By AI</h4>
      <p>
        While research and scholarship seek to understand and draw conclusions
        about bisexuals as a group, every bisexual person has a unique life and
        circumstances. Not every bisexual person will have someone near them to
        turn to who understands their identity and stressors, and not every
        bisexual has the same definition of identity, the exact same stressors,
        or the same cultural background. Something that is a huge issue to a
        person who comes from a traditional background like someone who has
        immigrant parents, or a highly religious household is not a huge issue
        to someone from another environment. While there are complex machine
        learning models, BiBot is intended to give generalized advice and
        resources based upon research findings. It is generalized as the intent
        is to reach as many bisexual people as possible who need assistance and
        promote bivisibility. Therefore, a link to LGBT Chat (n.d.) is provided.
        It gives the person a chance to connect with other LGBTQ+ individuals
        who have been in that person’s situation or a similar one and may be
        able to offer their own experiences and solutions.
      </p>
      <h4 class="paper">Section 5—Emergency or Crisis Situation</h4>
      <p>
        There are mental health disparities and emergency and crisis situations
        from minority stressors and lower levels of social and familiar support.
        The Human Rights Campaign (2015) has a guide on health disparities that
        helped inform this section and the situations BiBot users may be in, and
        the appropriate phone numbers and websites were found and put in the
        training and coding document. These issues include depression, anxiety,
        suicide ideation, alcohol, and substance abuse. The idea to include
        sexual assault and domestic abuse phone lines came from data sets from
        the Center for Disease Control (2018), which found that those with a
        bisexual orientation face higher rates of sexual assault and domestic
        violence than other orientations. This can be attributed to people
        thinking bisexuals are promiscuous, hypersexual, and other negative
        stereotypes.
      </p>
      <h4 class="paper">Section 6—Political Concerns or Fears</h4>
      <p>
        This initial incarnation of BiBot is for people in the United States and
        was written with Americans in mind. LGBTQ+ rights have come a long way
        in the United States since the Stonewall Riots in 1969. However, there
        is still so far to go for LGBTQ+ individuals in the United States.
        State-level laws that have significant impacts. Gay, lesbian, and
        bisexual youth are at a higher risk for suicide, and Raifman et al.
        (2017) found that after same-sex marriage laws were passed in 2015 that
        the outcome was that there were 134,000 fewer adolescent suicides. Laws
        have huge and heavy implications for the quality of LGBTQ+ lives. Even
        though someone can now marry who they love, there are varying laws on
        adoption, discrimination, and 1 in 5 LGBTQ+ American’s live in poverty
        (Lee Badgett et al., 2019). Therefore, BiBot encourages political
        awareness and suggests ways to get involved in politics.
      </p>
      <h4 class="paper">Section 7—Healthcare</h4>
      <p>
        The Human Rights Campaign (2015) examined many studies and found that
        bisexual people face numerous health disparities and that 39% of
        bisexual men and 33% of bisexual women do not disclose their orientation
        to medical providers. Unfortunately, many bisexuals have faced
        discrimination, discrimination, biphobia, and bias in health care
        settings. The health issues in the trading and coding document were
        informed by the Human Rights Campaign (2015). The health issues that
        arise were ones that came up in the emergency or crisis section, such as
        anxiety, depression, suicide ideation, substance abuse. The sexual
        health disparities were touched on. BiBot points the user to the Human
        Rights Campaign’s (2015) inclusive guide to sexual health since and the
        San Francisco AIDS Foundation (2019) website. These are important links
        to give since so many do not disclose their orientation and may not get
        the information that they need to engage in safer sex practices. It was
        essential to provide those links, especially to those under 18 who may
        not disclose their orientation and get the care that they need. Arbeit
        et al. (2016) studied bisexual adolescent females and found that sex
        education in schools was either stressing abstinence or heterosexual
        safe sex practices. Only 38% of the adolescent girls had told their
        doctor their orientation because they did not want the doctor to
        disclose to their parents about their orientation, sexual activity, or
        if they had an STI. Ultimately BiBot tells bisexuals of all ages that
        they should reference the Human Rights Campaign’s (2019) healthcare
        equality index to search for healthcare near them that is inclusive of
        LGBTQ+ patients.
      </p>
      <h3 class="paper">Discussion</h3>
      <p>
        This work is just the groundwork to make bisexuality more visible and
        covers some broad basics of the bisexual experience. The AI concept is
        by no means extensive and has shortcomings. The Gates (2011) and Pew
        Research Center (2013) appear to be the last big demographic counts of
        the LGBTQ+ population. Therefore, there is a gap in the scholarship. The
        labels and language of being an LGBTQ+ person have evolved since. The
        language to identify and classify the population has since changed. The
        other shortcoming is that this design lacks universal design. This was
        designed specifically for people in the United States. The phone lines,
        websites, and resources were chosen for people in the United States and
        can to be altered for other locations as there are bisexual people all
        over the world. The other issue with this work related to universal
        design is that more voices and scholarship need to be factored in to
        meet the needs of unique bisexual lives. There are so many other
        intersections for people and their bisexual identity. These
        intersections include gender, transgender identities, race and
        ethnicity, and other aspects of the bi+ umbrella. Including more voices
        and scholarship creates a more inclusive BiBot, who and reaches more
        LGBTQ+ identities.
      </p>
      <h3 class="paper">Conclusions</h3>
      <p>
        It’s not the bisexual orientation that causes poor mental and physical
        health outcomes or unsafe situations; it is the minority stressors and
        people’s lack of knowledge on the definition of bisexuality. The impact
        of BiBot could be lifechanging AI to so many LGBTQ+ people, particularly
        those living in a small town and are struggling with their identity and
        minority stressors. As this work showed, there are many minority
        stressors that bisexuals live with that impact physical health, mental
        health, and safety. Since many bisexuals are not out with their
        identities, this chatbot could be of assistance. The goal of making this
        open-source work is to make bisexuality a more visible and understood
        identity and hopefully, there will be many incarnations of BiBot. With
        many BiBots made for phones and web browsers, there are more ways for
        bisexuals to interact with AI and learn that their identity is valid and
        that they have resources.
