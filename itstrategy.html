      <h2 class="paper">Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This work encourages healthcare organizations to make a goal to improve
        LGBTQ+ health in their community. LGBTQ+ individuals have experienced
        and continue to experience significant barriers to healthcare. These
        barriers contribute to serious health discrepancies. Training
        stakeholders like doctors and nurses about LGBTQ+ inclusive and
        competent is important, but it is not enough. This work presents a broad
        strategy to improve LGBTQ+ health. While training and communication are
        a vital part of the strategy, IT policy must also be encompassed. Many
        LGBTQ+ stakeholders hold concerns about confidentiality, and creating
        secure IT policies could address those concerns. IT policies also sets
        rules for analytics which could potentially change and improve practice.
        The strategy involves assessing security, research, and making
        alterations to the IT policies important to LGBTQ+ health or LGBTQ+
        patient concerns. The strategy also encourages making rules for data.
        Analyzing LGBTQ+ health records could lead to improving preventative
        care. Ultimately training, collecting analytics, and building a
        security-mined culture through IT policies are ways to minimize
        healthcare barriers and improve LGBTQ+ health outcomes.
      </p>
      <h2 class="paper">An IT Strategy to Improve LGBTQ+ Health</h2>
      <p>
        Thinking about IT policy and technology is needed in providing LGBTQ+
        competent healthcare. Training is necessary for doctors to learn
        inclusive and comprehensive LGBTQ+ healthcare. Training individuals to
        provide inclusive healthcare is essential, yet it is not enough.
        Organizations must think about their technologies when striving to
        provide inclusive care. Considering IT policy and organizational
        technologies is a strategy to improve LGBTQ+ healthcare. This work
        provides background on LGBTQ+ individuals seeking healthcare and
        presents a practical IT strategy for healthcare providers in the United
        States to make their organization LGBTQ+ inclusive.
      </p>
      <h2 class="paper">
        Background: Why There is a Need for LGBTQ+ Competence in Healthcare
      </h2>
      <p>
        For many LGBTQ+ individuals finding an LGBTQ+ competent doctor or health
        care provider is a challenge. The challenge lies in social and
        structural constructs. Healthcare providers may not be educated on
        LGBTQ+ matters and may have biases, making it hard for LGBTQ+ people to
        disclose their identity or feel safe disclosing their identity [2, 6,
        18, 22]. When researching LGBTQ+ populations in Arctic Canada, Logie et
        al. found three main concerns for LGBTQ+ individuals: heterosexism and
        cisnormativity, intersectional stigma, and concerns involving limited
        services and confidentiality [11].
      </p>
      <p>
        Heterosexism and cisnormativity is the assumption that each patient is
        heterosexual and cisgender. Intersectional stigma is hearing how a
        patient identifies their gender or sexuality and how others form
        judgments and assumptions about them. An example would be that a patient
        identifies as pansexual, and the doctor assumes that they have many
        partners and are practicing unsafe sex. As people are more than their
        gender and sexuality, other intersections of identity amplify this
        stigma; like race, culture, socioeconomics, or religion. Limited
        services are not providing all the services that are needed.
        Confidentiality concerns were rooted in data concerns and people in the
        office talking.
      </p>
      <p>
        These concerns are not unfounded for LGBTQ+ individuals. Mirza and
        Rooney examined the data found in a Center for American Progress survey
        [12]. Out of Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) respondents, 8%
        stated that a doctor refused to see them due to their actual or
        perceived sexual orientation, and 9% had a doctor, or other health care
        provider used harsh or abusive language when treating them. Mirza and
        Rooney also looked at transgender population statistics. Twenty-nine
        percent of respondents stated that a doctor or other health care
        provider refused to see them because of their actual or perceived gender
        identity, and 23% said a doctor or other health care provider
        intentionally misgendered them or used the wrong name [12].
      </p>
      <p>
        There are ways of searching for to finding LGBTQ+ competent doctors
        online. However, not every LGBTQ+ person has a way of getting to an
        LGBTQ+ competent doctor. The person might be underage or living in a
        rural area. Shaver et al. examined rural health care providers and found
        considerable gaps in providers' knowledge [17]. As a result, many LGBTQ+
        people do omit their identity in a doctor's office. Arbeit et al.
        studied bisexual female youth and found that 73% of their doctors
        assumed heterosexuality, and only 18% of the sample spoke to their
        doctor about having an LGBT identity [2].
      </p>
      <p>
        Minority status, stigma, biases, discrimination, microaggressions,
        erasure, and lack of knowledge and healthcare training are enormous
        barriers for LGBTQ+ individuals, especially if they have multiple
        minority identities [4,6]. These barriers lead to profound health
        disparities. The Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion
        describes that the disparities can depend on how the person identifies
        [15]. However, in general, the disparities are higher rates of mental
        health distress, tobacco, alcohol, and drug use, obesity, and females
        are less likely to seek out cancer screenings. There is also a need for
        sexual health screenings that aren't being met.
      </p>

        A Plan for Better LGBTQ+ Healthcare Using IT Policy and Strategies
      </h2>
      <h2 class="paper">
        Step One: Adopt a Goal and Educate Stakeholders About the Goal
      </h2>
      <p>
        The first step is to make an organizational goal and commit to improving
        LGBTQ+ healthcare. Take time to form a committee dedicated to this
        pursuit. Start by researching literature regarding LGBTQ+ healthcare.
        While the above section offers an overview, it is by no means
        comprehensive. Stakeholders performing research need to remember that
        different LGBTQ+ identities have different needs and experience
        different stigmas. However, even within the same identity label, two
        individuals may have entirely different needs and very different lives
        as there are many ways of being an LGBTQ+ person. It is important to
        remember that people are more than how they identify, so avoid thinking
        in terms of universals. Have the committee scour databases looking for
        journal articles relevant to LGBTQ+ health and create literature reviews
        or PowerPoint presentations to understand and reflect on the findings.
        Research like Shaver et al. has shown that doctors, nurses, and other
        care providers may have gaps in their knowledge regarding LGBTQ+
        individuals, especially in rural settings [17]. Research if there are
        training opportunities for stakeholders to learn more about LGBTQ+
        patients or make a mandatory meeting with an informative presentation.
      </p>
      <h2 class="paper">Step Two: Assess</h2>
      <p>
        IT and organizational goals need an alignment. Therefore, it is
        necessary to assess current technology practices and IT policies.
        Perform a security assessment. In evaluating the findings, think about
        what was discovered about LGBTQ+ individuals and their concerns, compare
        other organizations' IT practices, and identify any IT policies'
        weaknesses. Where applicable, be sure LGBTQ+ inclusive language is used
        in the IT policies.
      </p>
      <h3 class="paper">Concerns Regarding EHR Records and Security</h3>
      <p>
        Making and storing electronic healthcare records (EHR) must meet
        standards. These standards include Health Insurance Portability and
        Accountability Act (HIPAA), Health Information Technology for Economic
        and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
        Even with standards in place, Logie et al. found confidentiality remains
        a concern for LGBTQ+ individuals [11]. Sexual orientation and gender
        identity (SOGI) data and EHR data are sensitive pieces of data.
        Healthcare providers are targets of cybercriminals. Cybercriminals'
        motivation is varied. Typically, a cyber-attack is financially
        motivated, and cybercriminals go after personally identifiable
        information (PII) and protected health information (PHI) [1]. These
        pieces of information can be bought and sold by criminals and are used
        for phishing messages, financial fraud, and identity theft.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confidentiality remaining a concern for LGBTQ+ people is not unfounded.
        Lemberg wrote for a law journal and found instances where hacked (SOGI)
        data and medical records have been used in blackmail scenarios [10].
        There are no anti-discrimination laws at the federal level, so the
        outcome of a blackmail scenario falls into anti-discrimination laws at
        the state level. Not all 50 states have state-level laws to protect
        LGBTQ+ individuals from discrimination. As a result of the lack of legal
        protections, Lemberg found instances where people were fired, denied
        housing, evicted, and had their family lives damaged or destroyed [10].
      </p>
      <p>
        Healthcare organizations need to firmly keep in mind that meeting HIPAA,
        HITECH, ACA compliance, and any other healthcare compliance does not
        mean the organization is secure or holding good security practices. It
        is essential to review what was discovered in the security assessment.
        While reviewing, consider the predominant cybersecurity challenges in
        healthcare which are; employee errors, cloud threats, phishing attacks,
        malware and ransomware, encryption creating blindspots that hackers can
        hide from the tools used to detect breaches, and cybercriminals slightly
        devising a similar URL to give the illusion that their duplicitous
        creation it is part of the organization [20]. Think critically about the
        findings and predominant cybersecurity challenges in healthcare. Use
        this moment of assessment to think about the IT policy portfolio to
        build a security-minded culture at the organization.
      </p>
      <h2 class="paper">Step Three: Areas of IT Portfolio Alterations</h2>
      <p>
        This section outlines the areas of IT portfolio alterations that should
        be considered in meeting the goal of providing LGBTQ+ competent
        healthcare. Remember that there are no definitive ways or
        all-encompassing blank templates in addressing policy. While there are
        guidelines, research, and policies from other organizations that serve
        as a solid basis for emulation, the committee must keep in mind that
        every organization is different. Therefore, each policy document must be
        molded to fit the organization and its identity. When approaching each
        document, it is necessary to consider relevant compliances and laws.
        Research those while working on each document and address them in the
        document's body.
      </p>
      <h3 class="paper">SOGI</h3>
      <p>
        Make it part of the organization's IT policy portfolio to collect and
        protect sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data. Healthcare
        is a data-driven field. Cruz's commentary on collecting SOGI was that
        big data analytics systems using artificial intelligence and machine
        learning have the potential to improve healthcare rapidly [3]. The data
        has the potential to transform health care policies, administration, and
        clinical practice. Understanding SOGI and other sociodemographics
        through artificial intelligence and machine learning is a predictive way
        of intervening and reducing health disparities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collecting SOGI should make it, so LGBTQ+ individuals don't have to come
        out repeatedly at every doctor's appointment and minimize erasure.
        Gessner et al. interviewed an individual where every appointment they
        had to explain that they are a lesbian [6]. Every appointment, the
        doctor said they would note it in the person's chart. The doctor never
        made a note. The repeated incident left the individual feeling erased,
        not taken seriously, and not listened to at the doctor's office.
        Prioritizing SOGI data in an IT policy could reduce such incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
        There will likely be a need to optimize or customize EHR systems to make
        accurate and consistent SOGI data collection a reality. Commonly the IT
        staff at the healthcare organization works directly with the EHR vendor.
        Upon making SOGI part of IT policy and getting the EHR software
        configured, training to collect, read, and prioritize SOGI data will all
        be necessary. Have a team examine the analytics regarding SOGI and
        report the findings. The findings will improve organizational practices
        and services to help fight disparities.
      </p>
      <h3 class="paper">Access Controls Standards Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Reviewing and altering the access controls standards policy is a place
        to document the rules for keeping both physical and digital assets safe,
        which addresses LGBTQ+ confidentiality concerns. This minimizes the
        potential of someone being inadvertently outed or in a blackmail
        situation. Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society
        stresses that IT policies in healthcare strongly need policies that
        establish rules for protecting physical security [8]. Having policies
        around physical security is a way of protecting digital assets.
        Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society states that other
        physical hacking techniques like installing a keylogger record passwords
        and additional sensitive information also need to be factored into an
        organization's plan [8]. Make relevant rules for keeping physical
        security safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        This policy also sets controls for digital security. These rules are
        about logging in and out, walking away from the computer station, and a
        permission scheme about who can access data. Permissions and passwords
        keep people out of sensitive data like EHR and SOGI. National Institute
        of Standards Technology notes, ensure whatever control configuration
        scheme in place makes sure it doesn't leak data [13]. Testing for data
        leaks is important to test. Testing ensures that work in this area and
        the policy is not pointless.
      </p>
      <h3 class="paper">Security Awareness and Training</h3>
      <p>
        While the access controls standards set security rules, the security
        awareness and training policy will set rules to inform and train
        relevant stakeholders about security protocols and practices essential
        to the healthcare organization. Anyone with access to organizational
        computers and accessing sensitive data needs to have it stressed that
        they play an integral role in keeping private data private. Once again,
        this document should reduce the odds of an LGBTQ+ stakeholder from being
        inadvertently outed or having aspects of their medical chart known by
        others that they did not disclose personal information to.
      </p>
      <p>
        A security awareness and training policy need to include advanced staff
        training, but it also needs to encompass patients. Having something like
        a website or small online module informing patients on best practice
        security practices for accessing their cloud data is also important.
        Most individuals are not IT experts, and it needs to be assumed that
        they likely do not know best security practices. Assuming stakeholders
        have no previous knowledge is a way of informing all in an
        easy-to-understand manner. If patients don't understand security
        practices for accessing health data on a cloud, they may as well be
        handing over their medical records, possibly to strangers or people in
        their lives who shouldn't see the charts.
      </p>
      <h3 class="paper">Acceptable Use</h3>
      <p>
        A developed acceptable use policy is essential to addressing LGBTQ+
        stakeholders' concerns about confidentiality [10, 11]. The policy tells
        employees how organizational technology can be used and stresses that
        technology must be used in ethical, legal, and responsible ways. It will
        emphasize the appropriate compliances and state that unauthorized access
        or misappropriation of access like saving organizational files has
        serious repercussions.
      </p>
      <h3 class="paper">BYOD</h3>
      <p>
        Since the pandemic, the worlds between work and home are increasingly
        blurred as people need to work remotely. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
        up to half of the American workers worked remotely from home [9]. Bring
        your own device (BYOD) policies are a way to increase employee
        productivity and save money on the IT budget. However, BYOD has security
        risks that need to be addressed. Addressing the security risks is
        integral to keeping LGBTQ+ patients' information and all patient data
        secure and safe. Shahane listed that an ideal BYOD in healthcare
        addresses legislation and compliances, controls the use of third-party
        apps on the network, containerizes personal and professional data to
        maintain employee privacy, enforces organizational security and privacy
        policies, provides an uninterrupted communication channel for staff,
        deploys specifically approved apps, and specifies plans to wipe data
        should a device end up lost or stolen [16].
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately a BYOD policy needs to explicitly state which stakeholders
        can participate and explain the purpose of BYOD. Explain what devices
        are eligible for BYOD and have the IT department use a mobile device
        management (MDM) solution to control corporate-owned devices'
        configurations. An MDM should help with security as it makes it so the
        device owner can't sidestep around necessary security configurations,
        and it should reduce the threat of shadow IT. In the case of healthcare,
        an MDM will assist in maintaining legislation and compliances.
      </p>
      <p>
        The MDM will come in handy should someone exit or have a device lost or
        stolen. The MDM will partition personal data, and IT staff can remotely
        wipe company files from the individual's device. This is great for
        healthcare scenarios because a remote wipe could stop people from
        accessing PII, PHI, SOGI, and EHR data. In the case of LGBTQ+
        stakeholders, this helps keep them safe from being outed, blackmailed,
        or discriminated against. Ensure that the policy addresses important
        contacts. Stakeholders need to know who to contact if there are any
        security concerns or suspect a breach. Knowing who to communicate with
        should a concerning situation arise is vital in building a
        security-minded culture.
      </p>
      <h3 class="paper">Information Technology Planning</h3>
      <p>
        Information technology planning. Information technology planning is how
        organizations plan to upgrade their technology. When this is done
        regularly, organizations can plan to allocate IT budgets to refresh and
        upgrade their IT. Planning makes getting new IT a more affordable
        process with an easier transition. While strict budgets regarding IT are
        a reality, it is necessary to make upgrades. While upgrading takes time,
        planning, money, and training, it is necessary for keeping all patient
        data safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Legacy systems are computer operating systems that aren't supported
        anymore. While legacy systems still technically work, they pose a
        considerable security risk to the organization. The lack of support
        means that they are no longer receiving updates and security patches,
        which leaves all systems and data, including LGBTQ+ patient data,
        vulnerable. Leaving people vulnerable hurts the credibility of the
        organization. Besides dodging the potential for imminent danger taking
        upgrading IT means that there are better clinician-patient experiences,
        current software available, and the potential to have a higher return on
        investment (14).
      </p>
      <h3 class="paper">Media Protection and Disposal</h3>
      <p>
        When new technology is acquired, there is a need to get rid of old
        technology. Therefore, there need to be rules regarding the disposal of
        old technology. It can't just go in a dumpster or straight to an
        electronic recycling center. It needs to be done safely so no one can
        obtain anyone's PHI. Steps to dispose of technology safely are
        especially important for LGBTQ+ stakeholders. This is another way others
        could access SOGI or any other sensitive health record related to their
        identity, leading to incidences like Lemberg noted involving
        discrimination, damage, and harm [10]. A computer in a dumpster or that
        went straight to electronic recycling is essentially allowing strangers
        a chance to access the organization and all its sensitive records.
        —Health and Human Services state HIPAA compliant ways of getting rid of
        old electronics [7]. The first is clearing, which is when software or
        hardware overwrites the media with non-sensitive data. There is also
        purging, which is when a strong magnet is taken to media to disrupt
        recorded data. Lastly, destruction is also an option where it can be
        melted, incinerated, disintegrated, or any other measure which destroys
        the media.
      </p>
      <h3 class="paper">Data Governance</h3>
      <p>
        The point of a data governance policy is to preserve data integrity and
        keep confidential records confidential. While this policy will keep EHR
        protected, it also dictates how data can be used in healthcare. Data
        governance is vital in healthcare as the policy's goals should be to
        improve populations' health, reduce health care costs, and improve
        patient experiences and care [21]. The point of collecting SOGI, besides
        making it, so people don't have to come out every appointment, is to
        inform practice and policy. Making rules about data governance will
        allow organizations to harness the potential of SOGI data collection.
        Analyzing this data is integral to improving LGBTQ+ health outcomes and
        patient care. Spending time crafting governance policies doesn't just
        protect data; it allows informed stakeholders to analyze data. The
        results of the analysis could potentially predict or address serious
        LGBTQ+ health disparities.
      </p>
      <h3 class="paper">Telemedicine</h3>
      <p>
        Telemedicine is a growing way for people to gain access to healthcare.
        FOLX Health is an LGBTQ+ telemedicine platform specializing in queer and
        trans health [5]. Because using their platform is a way of getting
        healthcare FOLX Health has an extensive privacy policy [5]. The privacy
        policy aims to explain what data is collected and what pieces of data
        will be shared with the patient's healthcare provider. FOLX Health also
        states how they are handling PHI according to HIPAA regulations [5].
        Making IT, policies explaining data collection and security practices
        for telemedicine may help LGBTQ+ individuals feel comfortable in seeking
        healthcare. On a telemedicine platform, LGBTQ+ patients can talk to a
        professional in an environment that they are comfortable in, which may
        help with the patient's anxiety and stress regarding stigma, judgment,
        and confidentiality.
      </p>
      <h2 class="paper">Step Four: Communication Plan</h2>
      <p>
        The committee needs to go through the organization's procedures to pass
        policy changes. Build the security culture and make sure that the IT
        policies are saved to easily accessible cloud storage. Saving to cloud
        storage allows for all stakeholders to reference IT policies at any
        necessary point. Make sure that stakeholders receive training or watch
        presentations about LGBTQ+ patients. Employees will need to know about
        the IT policy changes, so ensure that there are meetings and training
        about the changes. Stress that security is essential and that every
        stakeholder's actions impact the organization's security and patient
        data. Making time for questions, clarifications, and concerns is vital
        to creating a culture concerned with security. Ensure that employees
        know how to contact people in the IT department and other supervisors to
        answer questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        LGBTQ+ individuals need to know the organization's commitment to
        inclusive and confidential care. Make targeted advertising campaigns to
        reach LGBTQ+ individuals and tell them that LGBTQ+ healthcare is
        important and that the organization is committed to LGBTQ+ care in
        practice and policy. Advertise on LGBTQ+ social media and websites.
      </p>
      <h2 class="paper">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        he commitment to LGBTQ+ health outcomes is a two-pronged approach. The
        first is educating and training stakeholders about LGBTQ+ individuals
        and their health. The second is the presented IT policy strategy because
        training is not enough to minimize LGBTQ+ health disparities. While the
        strategy catered to considering LGBTQ+ health, much of this is mostly
        thinking thoroughly about practicing good security. Use IT policy to
        make a security culture at healthcare organizations, and if possible,
        Lemberg states to offer incentives [10]. Reinforce good security
        practices and make security part of everyday conversations. LGBTQ+
        patients need to know that they have a safe place to get competent and
        up-to-date healthcare. Many LGBTQ+ people put off health care
        appointments due to stigma, judgments, and having to explain their
        identity. Putting off cancer tests or other necessary screenings can be
        a life-or-death matter for anyone, but LGBTQ+ populations have extra
        barriers to getting care. Training staff and making IT policies
        stressing security and analytics can be used to minimize LGBTQ+ health
        barriers and disparities.
