        <p>
          When it comes to security, specifically cybersecurity experts and
          scholars alike often make a variation of the statement that the people
          within the organization can be both the biggest asset and the biggest
          liability. Such a statement is a reflection of the challenges a
          cybersecurity expert faces at work. They have to convey to so many
          individuals the concept of risk and what constitutes risky behaviors.
          Successful governance means that they have effectively conveyed these
          concepts. This work examines risk governance and management and
          proposes original research asking cybersecurity experts about their
          practices.
        </p>
        <h2 class="paper">Background</h2>
        <p>
          Trying to run cybersecurity for an organization is a challenging and
          demanding job that requires vigilance and great responsibility. While
          doing their job, the cybersecurity expert considers and thinks about
          an institution’s finances, goals, reputation, consumer perceptions,
          good faith, and fears. They spend time staying abreast of the latest
          tools and technologies, and threats. However, all the time, in front
          of the latest journals, industry reports, and adopting the most
          high-end tools will not do anything unless strong governance policies
          and practices are in place, emphasizing the concept of risk and how
          actions can correlate to risk. Successful risk management governance
          is vital to protecting both the company assets and the sensitive data
          of consumers. Devos and Van de Ginste (2015) found that when
          businesses or other institutions implemented a governance framework,
          they saw a 40% higher return than places that had nothing in place.
          Consumers want risk management governance for their most sensitive
          data. An extreme example of a few people not performing risk
          management is last year when the intimate technology company
          Vibratissimo failed to protect their company data. The data of 50,000
          customers, including addresses, were left out in plain text, with no
          one taking protection measures like encryption (Fox-Brewster, 2018).
          People felt violated because someone was not performing governing risk
          very well nor performing risk management tasks adequately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even with implementing governance policies and frameworks, an increase
          like the one Devos and Van de Ginste (2015) noted is not guaranteed.
          Whatever risk governance frameworks or policies are implemented needs
          to reach each end-user, which is why studying risk governance and
          management is essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this work, it might seem like risk governance and risk
          management is used interchangeably. They are two different ideas that
          share a relationship. It can be simply thought of as governance as a
          board of managers devising rules, and management is the people and
          tactics used to enforce the rules. Both require and provide
          leadership, but one does the theory, and one does the practice. To use
          a military analogy, one leads in the war room, and one leads out on
          the battlefield. For things to work, the theory and rule devising and
          practice properly and enforcing need to share a relationship, hence
          why in this paper, they may sometimes be spoken in almost the same
          breath and almost synonymously. It is not necessarily out of laziness
          or sloppiness, but for risk to effectively be mitigated by strong risk
          governance and strong risk management need to be in place. Both
          systems should feed off of each other and give each other feedback.
        </p>
        <h2 class="paper">Problem Statement</h2>
        <h3 class="paper">Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Not all risk governance and management are successful or effective.
          The hard part of implementing governance frameworks and policies is
          reaching everybody and making sure they understand that the actions
          they take matter, even the seemingly innocuous ones. Many people do
          risky things with their technology in the workplace innocently. People
          simply do risky things without thought, knowledge, or because the risk
          lets them do a job quicker or better. Maybe they want to connect their
          phone via USB to the computers to have it charge because the battery
          is really low, or they want to show off some photos they took on
          vacation. Many people wouldn’t think anything of such an action, but
          it can have some massive security ramifications like introducing
          malware to the network. Another way people innocently put the network
          at risk is shadow IT. Many people adopt shadow IT with the
          justification of saving time or thinking that the device or program
          helps them do a better job. Unsecured shadow IT has enormous risks as
          the technology may have vulnerabilities, it may not be being backed up
          properly, and it could cause a breach or data loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crux of the problem is what are the most effective ways and
          methods to govern risk management. How do we get through to people to
          let them know that the activities above pose danger? Any workplace or
          institution has technologies from all walks of life, different levels
          of formal education, different ways of learning, and interpreting
          information. However, Wachinger et al. (2013) found that it is not so
          much the cultural or individual factors that create the concept of
          risk perception. Instead, risk perception is shaped by experiences and
          a mediator such as an IT security professional. So, it is crucial to
          connect with end-users. Dialogues, conversations, meetings are
          critical to risk governance. These moments are vital to risk
          governance because they convey to end users that their actions matter
          and impact security, the organization, and its goals. When people
          don’t have these moments, they won’t understand what comprises risk,
          and when that is the case, chaos quietly lurks around the corner.
        </p>
        <h3 class="paper">Impact</h3>
        <p>
          The impacts of not having moments to connect with end-users and figure
          out the best ways to explain risk to them are financial and
          reputational damages. According to IBM’s (2019) most recent study on
          data breaches, the worldwide average data breach costs USD 3.92
          million. The average lifecycle between a breach was 279 days, with the
          average data breach impacting 25,575 records. The United States has
          the most expensive data breaches. The national average is USD 8.19
          million, and the costliest industry to experience a breach is
          healthcare, which typically costs USD 6.45 million. These are some
          staggering numbers. The average data breach also impacts company
          perceptions, and consumers can also be left feeling violated and
          scared about identity theft. The Ponemon Institute (2014) found that
          79% of people expressed concern about becoming an identity theft
          victim after a breach. Those surveyed had responses that varied
          between somewhat concerned to extremely concerned. Likely a breach or
          incident is going to change the way people also feel about the
          company, which means that perceptions regarding reputation and
          trustworthiness have been damaged. A company’s finances, reputation,
          consumer perception, and trust are the biggest impacts of a breach
          resulting from ineffective risk management.
        </p>
        <p>
          Employees are also impacted by ineffective risk management. Not
          knowing which of their actions are risky and ineffective explanations
          about policy and procedure makes people feel like they are set up for
          failure and walking into a situation that they don’t know how to
          navigate. Not having adequate explanations about navigating a
          situation can make people feel like failures and unimportant. Those
          are dreadful feelings that make people hate their jobs. No one wants
          to walk around feeling very small and unimportant. It makes people
          feel like their roles, performance, and value is not of any worth.
          When people hate their work environment, they stop caring, get sloppy
          in performance, and spend their evenings online filling out
          application after application looking to get out. Sloppiness may mean
          more risky behaviors. Those with a streak for sabotage may
          intentionally create a cyber incident. Upon the employee parting ways
          with the company, the employers have to go through the process of
          replacing the person who left. Each time this happens, it is a draw on
          assets because it takes money and time to hire and train a new person.
        </p>
        <h2 class="paper">Why the Problem Exists</h2>
        <p>
          Inadequate planning and poor organization by IT security professionals
          or, more generally, the organization are often the reason for
          deficient understandings of risk. People end up somewhat confused when
          professionals within the organization fail to develop strong organized
          governance programs thoroughly. The outcome of ineffective governance
          is chaos because people don’t know their roles and what is risky
          behaviors. This type of situation happens because structure is not
          present, and the organization has failed to designate leadership. The
          MITRE Corporation (2016) found that successful and effective
          governance happens when people know the desired outcomes, when people
          know how decisions should be made and monitored, and most importantly,
          there is a chain of command that knows their responsibilities and what
          they are accountable for. When people are not aware of what is
          constituting a risk or what constitutes policy and procedure, the
          chain of command is either not working, or someone is not performing
          their job. Perhaps the entire governance policy was poorly designed
          and not thoroughly tested to see if it worked. Designing a good
          governance policy involves time, research, testing with all
          stakeholders, and concise and simple language writing. The written
          portion needs to have concise and simple language so people can
          reference it quickly to navigate a situation without feeling
          overwhelmed or like it is too hard. The policy and its writings simply
          need to tell people how their desired behaviors will align with
          company goals. Employees need to know why what they are doing matters.
          When they have a simple explanation, it becomes easy to incorporate
          into the work routine. However, even with a governance plan and policy
          in place, regular revisions are necessary. A situation where people do
          not understand their roles or actions could be because what is in
          place is no longer working or is out of date. Regular monitoring needs
          to lead to regular revisions, which make good governance a reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another real-world reason people don’t understand risk is that some
          places have established strong management, but management sends mixed
          messages on what is acceptable. IT governance teams should also work
          hard to send united messages on what constitutes a risk or policy and
          procedure. The reason for this could be different interpretations of a
          policy or maybe even managerial preferences. Nonetheless, it is
          horrible for an employee to show up to work on Monday and have manager
          Y state one thing and then on Tuesday have manager Z state something
          different. Inconsistent mixed messages make employees feel lost at
          work and like they are just muddling through the day. That employee
          just ends up trying to remember what actions work in front of manager
          Y and what actions fly in front of manager Z. They don’t really know
          policy.
        </p>
        <h2 class="paper">Goal</h2>
        <p>
          There have been many pieces of research that study governing risk, and
          it is also a common subject in trade publications. Everyone has a
          take, and the thing is that sometimes what is written does not always
          translate into real-world practice very well. This research aims to
          find out how successful and effective governance works in real-world
          practice. What types of common policies are in place, but also what
          are IT professionals doing in practice to govern risk? Maybe they are
          relying on regular meetings. Maybe they email briefings. Also, it is
          important to know what they have tried, failed at, and learned while
          governing risk. Not all approaches work, and getting insights from a
          seasoned professional on what has failed or needed to be amended is
          vital, so others in the profession can also learn from the findings.
          Sometimes more can be learned from failures rather than successes,
          especially to an aspiring IT person who does not have a great deal of
          first-hand experience to draw upon.
        </p>
        <p>
          This research will be measured by seeing how real-world answers given
          are matching or not matching journal articles and trade publications.
          If answers are vastly different, the chances to ask research subjects
          elaborate, why will be presented, and numbers related to cyber
          incidents will be collected. Data like IBM (2019) collected, such as
          asking about how many cyber incidents they have dealt with and average
          days between incidence, will lend credence and credibility to the
          respondent’s answers.
        </p>
        <h3 class="paper">Relevance and Significance</h3>
        <p>
          Risk governance needs to be studied more because it will always be
          relevant and significant to protecting company assets and should help
          grow them. Cybercriminals are always growing more sophisticated, and
          companies and institutions need risk governance to stay in operation.
          The foundation of all the time, research, and all the ideas that a
          company or institution develops can shatter or be greatly damaged
          without risk governance. They also need risk governance to cultivate a
          trustworthy image and show that they care and respect the personal
          data that others are sharing with them. Having defined risk governance
          and management means that everyone knows what risk is and that they
          know their responsibilities. When people know what constitutes policy
          and procedure, they know what is expected of them and are less likely
          to make a mistake. This should reduce turnover, which reduces risk as
          former employees can be an outsider threat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The outcome of this research is to create a work about and for the
          field. The subject is going to seem like a very ground-level or novice
          focus of IT and cybersecurity research, but in all honesty, I am a
          novice. Hearing the voices and collected knowledge of seasoned
          professionals give the novice some tried and true experiences to draw
          upon. Also, such a work is good for the seasoned professional who is
          running up against something they haven’t before or simply would like
          to see a consensus of thoughts from the field to shape their own
          decision making. Whether it is the eyes of the novice or the seasoned
          expert, seeing what has and has not worked in terms of risk management
          is helpful to our job performances and protecting the vital assets of
          the organization that is our employer. Ultimately the research
          proposed in this work is intended to be a conversation and reflection
          of the people in the field and their discernments when it comes to
          risk governance and management that will inform those researching and
          creating policies. The intent is to inform and assist IT professionals
          in lowering data breaches, cyber incidents and provide more ways of
          reaching end users when it comes to risk management.

        <h2 class="paper">Literature Review</h2>
        <p>
          In my approach to understanding academic findings and conversations
          that will inform my study, I created the following categories academic
          journals about risk governance, academic journals about risk
          management, trade publications and reputable websites on risk
          governance, and trade publications and reputable websites on risk
          management.
        </p>
        <h3 class="paper">Academic Journals About Risk Governance</h3>
        <p>
          The first work examined was Wachinger et al. (2013), who wrote “The
          Risk Perception Paradox—Implications for Governance and Communication
          of Natural Hazards.” The article examines literature to find insights
          on risk perceptions. Although not specifically about IT or
          cybersecurity risks, the findings inspired the study proposed in this
          work. Wachinger et al. (2013) found that personal experiences are the
          basis of risk perception. Cultural or individual factors can either
          amplify or minimize perceptions and act as a link to how to perceive
          and act. This intriguing read gives credence to IT people using
          emulators or acting out scenarios to connect with end-users. The
          activities give them a personal experience to draw upon in real-world
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Srikandini et al. (2018) wrote, “Disaster Risk Governance in Indonesia
          and Myanmar: The Practice of Co-Governance.” This work was about the
          practice of co-governance in disaster risk reduction. The focus was on
          Indonesia and Myanmar because both nations are prone to natural
          disasters. One would think that having more actors involved could help
          reduce risk as more actors mean more hands and minds to push away and
          mitigate risk. This was not the case; both places had numerous
          stakeholders involved in disaster risk governance that were
          competitive with each other, and the ability to mitigate risk was
          impacted negatively. This was another risk governance article that was
          not about IT or cybersecurity but could have implications for IT and
          cybersecurity. It would be interesting to ask technology professionals
          if they have ever operated with a co-governance structure and if the
          findings were along the lines of Srikandini et al. (2018) unsuccessful
          due to competition or if, for some reason, co-governance was a
          smashing success due to shared goals, defined roles, or some other
          agreement.

          Shackelford (2017) wrote, “Human rights and cybersecurity due
          diligence: A comparative study,” which dealt with the fact that there
          are minimal international laws regulating cybersecurity and human
          rights. Shackelford (2017) makes a compelling case that companies
          should widen the scope of risk management that combines the two
          concepts. The two concepts can be combined by marrying human rights
          frameworks with cybersecurity frameworks. Many companies are looking
          to combine the concepts because it falls under the idea of sustainable
          development. Sustainable development is when economic growth does not
          compromise natural resources. The value of this piece is to help those
          in charge of risk management think about how actions and activities
          impact those outside the company and in other lands. Also, it helps
          them think about the potential legalities of actions and activities.
          This work is an important piece as it could inform my research and
          help ask questions asking professionals about how they combine risk
          mitigation and social responsibility.

          IT Governance (2019) is a website out of the United Kingdom that is a
          treasure trove of information on risk governance. Many leading
          European and international companies such as Volkswagen, Barclays,
          Intel, and HSBC have relied on IT Governance for information and their
          services. The website explains how a cybersecurity risk assessment is
          conducted, what such an assessment can protect, and information on
          frameworks such as becoming ISO 27001 certified. Unfortunately, the
          website does not offer much in the way of professionals discussing
          their experiences with the ideas and concepts mentioned. However, it
          is a valuable resource to reference when encountering literature that
          gets into the specifics of these ideas.

          Belbey (2016) wrote about governance and social media. Social media is
          a great way of connecting with customers, offering special sales and
          promotions, promoting products, and connecting with customers offering
          glowing praise of the latest or diffusing the situation when they are
          not happy. However, navigating governance and social media is
          presenting its own new set of challenges. One of the biggest risks is
          a poorly worded or planned posting that either creates an unfortunate
          public opinion or where everyone states what they don’t like about the
          product or company. Risks also deal with companies functioning
          internationally and dealing with different standards on privacy and
          security. As far as risk mitigation goes, Belbey (2016) touches on
          extensive social media training involving videos and other interactive
          methods. These are great suggestions as they offer a memorable
          experience. However, an important governance suggestion was overlooked
          in this work, which is hiring someone whose only role is social media,
          and they have undergone training or have an extensive background.

          Corzine (2018) wrote, “What CISOs Wish They Could Tell Their Boards.”
          This work asked chief information security officers (CISO) via survey
          about the realities of managing cybersecurity risk and what the CISO
          wishes boards would understand about the job. The aspects of the job
          the respondents were asked about where information on the risk-based
          approach to cybersecurity as part of enterprise risk management,
          security budgets, and strategies for dealing with IT risks. This had a
          very surprising finding that board committees typically fail to be
          concerned with technology risks and strategies to deal with risk,
          which leaves CISOs absolutely and rightfully frustrated. This is a
          huge oversight by boards because people, whether accidentally or on
          purpose, cause data breaches.

          High (2017) wrote an interesting piece that is almost a companion
          piece to Corzine (2018) that was written at an earlier date. High’s
          (2017) piece is from the board's perspective, giving recommendations
          to cybersecurity and risk management. High (2017) stresses “the
          basics,” which is using best practices. Also, devise a risk policy
          with concisely written statements. Make a risk report using analytics
          that can shape future policy. Have ways of checking the policy and
          performing revisions. Lastly, High (2017) emphasized that risk
          management needs to focus on people and company culture. These are
          very simple points that are great real-world practices, particularly
          the focus on best practices and the emphasis on people and company
          culture.

          Because one of the most widely used risk management frameworks is the
          National Institute of Standards and Technology (2019), their website
          must be examined. The NIST framework is comprised of guidelines, best
          practices, and standards. People involved with the project do their
          best to think internationally to meet standards and practices
          worldwide and connect and obtain perspectives from the international
          community. The NIST risk management framework has been translated into
          many languages and references many global standards. While it does not
          offer a lot of interviews with people using the standard and their ups
          and downs, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (2019)
          is a valuable resource for learning about the specifics of the risk
          management framework that so many places use.

        <h2 class="paper">Approach</h2>
        <p>
          The best approach to discover how ideas from scholarship and trade
          papers translate into real-world practices is to conduct a series of
          interviews. IT professionals who focus on cybersecurity will be sought
          out for interviews. This research project will be a series of
          interviews conducted over 90 days via a series of emails and videos on
          conferencing programs. This approach is taken to be flexible for the
          research subjects. They can be interviewed at the time that best works
          for them without any travel involved, which will mean that they are
          not being inconvenienced and have the time to offer thoughtful
          responses. The questions I will ask draw from scholarship findings and
          best practices covered in trade publications.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a mixed-methods study. For the quantitative side of the study,
          I want to get some numbers from each interview subject. I want to know
          how many breaches they have had to deal with and the average of days
          or years between cyber incidents that they have experienced. The
          quantitative numbers that they have give validity to the qualitative
          answers given. The qualitative questions are going to ask about risk
          governance policies and procedures that are in the place where they
          work. I want to know if they spearheaded any of them. I also want to
          know what they are doing daily to govern. I want to know how they
          connect with the people they have to govern and get through to them
          and understand what they need to do and why. I also want to know how
          they successfully govern and how they know that they are successfully
          governing. I want to know the times that they failed or didn’t quite
          get it right and what they did about it. Everybody makes mistakes, but
          how do the mistakes get fixed.
        </p>
        <h2 class="paper">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Discussions about what elements of risk governance is working and not
          working are needed to ward off cybercriminals, protect assets like
          computers, finances, reputation, and sensitive data. While it may seem
          common knowledge to implement risk governance to protect assets, not
          all governance is effective. The proposed research intends to spark
          discussions on what is and what has not worked helps the IT
          professional research in the creation of policy and aids in ways that
          they can start dialogues to connect with and inform employees. A work
          collecting the real-world experiences of IT professionals imparting
          their successes and failures involving risk governance and management
          and seeing how they stack against findings and advice in journals and
          trade publications is needed to help inform best practices. Hopefully,
          such a work can inform the IT professional, help them avoid mistakes,
          and help them create stronger policies and practices.
