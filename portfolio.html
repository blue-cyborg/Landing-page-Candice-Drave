            <p class="mb-3">
              I wrote this paper for a statistics midterm.  I had to make a paper on inferential 
              statistics. Inferential statistics is when the researcher has to discover a pattern 
              or property from samples of a population. Cryptography and discerning cyphertext was 
              the first thing that popped into my brain.  When you want to encrypt a file on your 
              computer, an algorithm is used.  The algorithm or cipher encodes the plain text, which 
              becomes cyphertext.  The cyphertext needs to be decrypted to view the plain text again. 
              Here is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia cyphertext article">Wikipedia page</a> about it.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Cyphertext existed long before modern computers. It was an integral part of 
              World War II.  The Germans had complex cipher machines called Enigma Machines. 
              In the United Kingdom, Alan Turing, a computer science pioneer and brilliant 
              mathematician, used inferential statistics and graph theory to crack the codes. 
              This paper breaks down how Turing worked to crack the codes. Math is truly 
              beautiful in its complexities. I wish I had the time to go back and get a four 
              year degree in math sometimes just because it’s pretty and I like a good puzzle.

            <p class="mb-5">
              When it comes to security, specifically cybersecurity experts and
        scholars alike often make a variation of the statement that the people
        within the organization can be both the biggest asset and the biggest
        liability. Such a statement is a reflection of the challenges a
        cybersecurity expert faces at work. They have to convey to so many
        individuals the concept of risk and what constitutes risky behaviors.
        Successful governance means that they have effectively conveyed these
        concepts. This work examines risk governance and management and proposes
        original research asking cybersecurity experts about their practices.

            <p class="mb-5">
              This work encourages healthcare organizations to make a goal to improve
        LGBTQ+ health in their community. LGBTQ+ individuals have experienced
        and continue to experience significant barriers to healthcare. These
        barriers contribute to serious health discrepancies. Training
        stakeholders like doctors and nurses about LGBTQ+ inclusive and
        competent is important, but it is not enough. This work presents a broad
        strategy to improve LGBTQ+ health. While training and communication are
        a vital part of the strategy, IT policy must also be encompassed. Many
        LGBTQ+ stakeholders hold concerns about confidentiality, and creating
        secure IT policies could address those concerns. IT policies also sets
        rules for analytics which could potentially change and improve practice.
        The strategy involves assessing security, research, and making
        alterations to the IT policies important to LGBTQ+ health or LGBTQ+
        patient concerns. The strategy also encourages making rules for data.
        Analyzing LGBTQ+ health records could lead to improving preventative
        care. Ultimately training, collecting analytics, and building a
        security-mined culture through IT policies are ways to minimize
        healthcare barriers and improve LGBTQ+ health outcomes.

            <p class="mb-5">
              This work aims to represent LGBTQ+ identities in Artificial Intelligence (AI). The work presents a document to train or code a BiBot, a bisexual chatbot, with resources for Bisexuals living in the United States. Bisexuals are the largest non-heterosexual orientation. Despite being the orientation with the largest share of people, bisexuals are either overlooked or lumped together with gay and lesbian populations. While there is some overlap with the gay and lesbian experience, bisexuals have their unique minority stressors. This work utilized both qualitative and quantitative research to pinpoint those issues to make the training or coding document. Many bisexuals feel like they are facing the unique minority stressors on their own, which is problematic and isolating for many. There are two goals of this AI. The first is to promote bivisibility, which is being bi and out, open, and proud. The second is to fight bi-erasure, which is when bisexuality is when people treat bisexuality like it is not a real and legitimate identity or deny that bisexuality even exists. The result of this research and the creations of BiBot is a way for bisexuals not to feel alone, invisible, and know that they have a valid identity. I didn’t put the training document with this paper because
